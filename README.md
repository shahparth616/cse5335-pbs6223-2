> What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?

I found the animation part implementation easy because it is easy to use and a lot of material on internet is easily available. Additionally animation can be done in various different ways which provides one freedom to use imagination and not to stick to any specifics.

> What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?

I found the one query at a time part hard. I was not clear how to store the passed ID from AJAX in Node JS. It took me a lot tries to find out how exactly it can be done. Plus the information on the internet was not that specific so I had to try any possibe combination I found on the internet. After a lot of tries it did work though. 

> If you were to use these technologies professionally, what would be your biggest
concern?

My biggest concern would be to provide as much as information I know on the internet and share my knowledge with other professionals like me. These language allows one to be creative and to try out different pieces of codes to get different results.
